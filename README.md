# spritesheet
Spritesheet system built for a small game I'm developing in pygame.
The spritesheet class is capable of extracting frames from a given spritesheet and storing them as a list, it can then play the animation from this list. Currently it is only capable of extracting frames stored in a single row for one animation, but can extract a given row from several on one sprite sheet.

demo.py provides a basic example of the spritesheet in action using a simple two frame animation from taken from the  [Sprout Lands Asset Pack by Cup Nooble ](https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-asset-pack).
